---------------------------------------------------------------------

[estimate-fentanyl-trends.R](estimate-fentanyl-trends.R) contains the R script used to fit and analyze Bayesian multilevel models for a manuscript analyzing trends in lethal fentanyl overdoses in Indianapolis. The dataset consists of every lethal overdose reported to the Marion County (Indianapolis) Coronerâ€™s Office from January 2010 through April 2017.

The script includes code to produce Figures [3](Figure-3.pdf), [4](Figure-4.pdf), and [5](Figure-5.png) from the paper.
